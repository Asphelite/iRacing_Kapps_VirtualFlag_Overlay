# Simple Flags Frame Duration (in milliseconds)
# Controls the flash speed of simple flags: green, yellow, white, debris
# Each value represents the duration of ONE state (on or off)
# Higher value = slower flashing (more noticeable but less annoying)
# Lower value = faster flashing (more attention-grabbing but potentially annoying)
# The loop count for each flag (above) still controls how many times it flashes
# For example: frame_ms=500 with green=1 means one 1s flash
#             frame_ms=250 with green=1 means one 0.5s flash (faster)
#             frame_ms=1000 with green=1 means one 2s flash (slower)

#
# Multi-Frame Flags Animation Speed (in milliseconds)
# Customize the animation speed for flags with multiple frames
# These control the duration of each animation frame for complex flag patterns
# Adjust to make flags more/less attention-grabbing
# Note: SC Variant Complex has fixed frame durations and cannot be customized here. Simple1 and Simple2 can be adjusted individually.
